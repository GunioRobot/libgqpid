README
======
libgqpid is the glib binding of qpid client. The idea behind this project was
to make sure that we will be able to use qpid directly from any C application.

Design
======
The library is written on top of the qpid C++ client library. The following
classes are implemented in the library still now:

  * g_qpid_connection
  * g_qpid_message
  * g_qpid_receiver
  * g_qpid_sender
  * g_qpid_session

The example code can be found at the examples directory.
